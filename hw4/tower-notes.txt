The implementation of the tower solver with
the finite domain solver was 4 times faster
than the implementation without the finite
domain solver.


Here is a case that satisfies `ambiguous`

C = counts([4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4],[4,2,2,1],[1,2,2,4])
N = 4
T1 = [[1,2,3,4],[2,1,4,3],[3,4,1,2],[4,3,2,1]]
T2 = [[1,2,3,4],[2,4,1,3],[3,1,4,2],[4,3,2,1]]
